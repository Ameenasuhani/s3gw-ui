[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/aquarist-labs/s3gw-ui/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=NGRK33SXRB)](https://codecov.io/gh/aquarist-labs/s3gw-ui)

The `s3gw-ui` project is the official user interface for the `s3gw` project.

It is a combination of two distinct components:

- the frontend, which can be found under `src/frontend/`
- the backend, which can be found under `src/backend/` and
  `src/s3gw_ui_backend.py`

Both the frontend and the backend have their specific `README.md` files, which
should be consulted for further information.
